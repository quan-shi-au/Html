                    <p>You wouldn't leave your car unlocked or your front door open while you went out for the day, as such recklessness would significantly increase the risk of theft. Surprisingly, although most Australians would recognise the sense in ensuring that their material possessions are protected against unauthorised entry, many do not take similar precautions in order to secure their virtual information. This oversight results in around 20% of people being a victim of some form of identity theft each year.</p>

                    <p>These days it's not just credit card details that can be used fraudulently: bank details, passport information, social security identification, driving licence data and even your email address can all be misappropriated by skilled identity fraudsters and used in illegal activity. The information may also be sold on, allowing other criminals to use it for their own benefit. Not only can victims end up having their bank accounts emptied and their credit cards used for illegitimate purposes, they may also find that their passport details are being used by someone else, their driving information has been used to construct a false licence and someone else is using their social security data to work illegally or claim benefits to which they're not entitled.</p>

                    <p>Unfortunately without the right security measures, anyone can be open to identity theft; you don't have to use a credit card or undertake some other form of online transaction in order to be at risk. If your private information is stored anywhere at all, there is potential for it to be stolen and used inappropriately.

                    <p>Our identity theft protection package includes everything you need for comprehensive coverage. We offer five main elements of protection: a secure desktop; an advanced security suite; a “watch and alert” facility; insurance and remediation. When used together, we find that these measures provide strong, reliable protection against a wide range of data theft threats. Online hackers, pickpockets and cash card fraudsters can all be consistently thwarted with these operations. Cover starts rapidly after sign up, so there's no need to wait weeks before you and those you care about can start enjoying the benefits identity theft protection can bring.</p>

                    <h3>We're on your side</h3>
                    <p>We understand how traumatic it can be to realise that you've been the victim of identity theft.

Many victims feel violated and extremely frightened by the experience. When you sign up with us, we continuously monitor your credit card activity, email use, passport number, social security number and more. If we notice that something unusual is going on, we'll contact you immediately so that any potential problem can be resolved rapidly. Pro-active management of a breach puts you in control, enabling you to swiftly deal with the situation.</p>

                    <h3>Remediation</h3>
                    <p>Should you be the victim of identity theft, we can work with you to undo the damage which has been caused. Not only will insurance usually cover any financial losses you have incurred, our skilled team can also work to resolve any issues which have come about as a result of fraudulent activity. For example, if your credit rating has been adversely affected by unauthorised use of your bank details or credit cards, we can work with the relevant agencies to restore it back to its usual condition.</p>

                    <p>If we spot activity which we believe to be suspicious, we want to let you know as quickly as possible. You can choose whether you wish to receive our alerts by email, phone or text, picking a medium that suits you best.

                    <p>SafeDesktop endpoint security solutions render malware inoperable. Using containerisation and hardening with patented security technologies, online activity is isolated from targeted threats. As a result, online shopping and banking transactions can be done without risk of triggering malware or exposing private information to deviants.</p>

                    <p>Even in the worst-case scenarios, when malware is already on the endpoint device, SafeDesktop protects credentials, login information and any personal or financial data-in-use at the deepest layer during the active online session.</p>

                    <p>SafeDesktop provides a pristine Windows desktop environment for online shopping and banking transactions and communications that barricades sensitive data-in-use from malware.</p>

                    <p>SafeDesktop adds depth to defences and is complementary to other security offerings such as AV, firewall and encryption. SafeDesktophas received consecutive certifications for effectiveness in online banking malware prevention from leading internet security research organisation, MRG Effitas.</p>

                    <h3>Advance Protection for Online Transactions</h3>
                    <p>SafeDesktop goes deep. Instead of the traditional industry paradigm of malware filtering, we go deeper to complement rather than replace current security solutions. SafeDesktop is secure by design to protect sensitive data during online transactions. No matter what.</p>

                    <p>idSafe SafeDesktop game-changing prevention model blocks malware more effectively and faster than any other solution available today – anywhere in the world.</p>

                    <h3>Antivirus Software (AV) isn’t enough</h3>
                    <p>SafeDesktop keeps online banking and shopping transactions safe from thieves who try to steal identities, or drain bank accounts. Today, antivirus software alone won’t stop them in time. A desktop or mobile device could be infected without the owner knowing it. SafeDesktop stops criminals before they can gain access to transactions containing personal data, passcodes, or account numbers.</p>

                    <p>SafeDesktop for a safe desktop and browsing for accessing websites that require exchange of personal or financial information. idSafe products work alongside existing firewall or antivirus software to protect transactions against even the latest threats such as keyloggers, botnets, trojans and account takeover (ATO) malware.</p>

                    <p>Detect compromised personal information sooner, no matter where it occurs through Watch & alert internet surveillance technology.</p>

                    <p>Do you know how your personal information is being used right now? If you don't, chances are your customers won't either, which is why watch & alert is such an important service to offer them. Without appropriate identity theft protection, many victims don't realise their information has been used illegally for some days or even weeks. Once stolen, it's common for personal information to be sold on via illegal online sites, enabling it to be used for anything from fake identification documents to credit card scams or other forms of criminal activity. Watch & alert provides a dependable answer to this problem, enabling personal information to be quickly recovered should theft take place.</p>

                    <h3>Checking millions of data points to keep your customers safe</h3>
                    <p>We use advanced technology to scan the sites and data points where stolen information is most likely to turn up. In addition to scanning for relevant credit card details and banking data, we can also check for other personally identifiable information (PII) which may have been taken, neutralising its value before it can be used for further illegal activity. Particularly where a person has used one password or username to protect a variety of sensitive online information, prompt detection of inappropriate use is essential in order to prevent hackers accessing all the other sites which the compromised password guards entry to.</p>

                    <h3>Global response to compromised data</h3>
                    <p>Watch & alert uses cutting-edge technology that's capable of accessing those areas of the net which are most likely to be markets for illegally obtained personal details. Our systems are capable of a global reach, searching internationally to check that our clients' information isn't being bought and sold. Different languages are no barrier to watch & alert, which undertakes advanced surveillance wherever it's needed.</p>

                    <h3>Continuous monitoring for peace of mind</h3>
                    <p>We undertake continual surveillance to ensure that, no matter what time of day or night personal information from one of our clients shows up where it shouldn't, we can deal with the matter rapidly. By the time a customer receives the alert that their private information has been obtained illegally, in many cases we will already have acted to prevent the situation from escalating. Contact us now for further information.</p>

                    <p>Having your ID stolen is a traumatic event for anyone. At least in Australia any money stolen from your personal accounts or credit cards is able to be recovered from your bank or financial institution. This doesn’t help though if someone has done something other than stolen your money – things like using your identity to run up debts or steal someone else’s property. This could require you to appoint professionals to help you put things right.</p>

                    <p>Most people who discover that they've been the victim of identity theft naturally feel violated and frightened.
